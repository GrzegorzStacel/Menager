# REST API - GAMES MENAGER
> This is my first fully responsive REST API application where you can create your own game library.
>
> We have the option of registering, logging in to your individual account and adding / removing / editing games and their developers.
>
> All data is stored in the cloud on a non-relational database [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
>
> The application works on the free cloud platform [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), which is associated with a few seconds of waiting for the application to start.
>
> Each new user who registers in the application has descriptions of games and companies created by default to his account.
